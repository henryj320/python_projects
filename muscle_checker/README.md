## muscle_checker

**Title**: muscle_checker

**Language**:Python

**Overview**: Input which exercises you completed this week. The system outputs which of the main muscles you missed this week and what exercises you could do to train them. This output is via a Flask website. The website contains two ways of generating the output - updating the .txt file or by inputting to the website.

In order to run my muscle_checker project, follow these steps:
1. Run "git clone ...".
2. cd into the muscle_checker directory.
3. Run "python3 -m venv venv" to create a new virtual environment to run the project inside.
4. Run ". venv/bin/activate" to activate the new environment.
5. Run "flask run --host=0.0.0.0" to start running the website.
6. Go to "127.0.0.1:5000".
