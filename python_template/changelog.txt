1. Created feature/python_template_core
2. Added a folder for it
3. Installed miniconda version 4.1.2(Python 3.8) into "Documents/Software/miniconda3"
        bash Miniconda3-py38_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
4. Made a README.md file for python_template
5. Installed cookiecutter
        conda config --add channels conda-forge
        conda install cookiecutter
5. Made a .gitignore file
6. Made a cookiecutter.json file and populated it
        {
           "python_version": ["py38"],
            "project_name": "python_template",
            "project_slug": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name | slugify }}",
            "author": "Henry James",
            "author_email": "henryj320@gmail.com",
            "directory_name": "Hello",
            "file_name": "basic_file",
            "greeting_recipient": "Henry"
        }
7. Inside of python_template, made a directory called {{cookiecutter.directory_name}}
        Contains "{{cookiecutter.}}" so that it can be set in cookiecutter.json
        mkdir
        cd into it
8. Added my files into {{cookiecutter.directory_name}}
9. Added directory_name, file_name and greeting_recipient to cookiecutter.json
        These are referenced making the new project, and can be referenced inside of files#
10. You can then make a new template from this
        cd into the place that you want to make the file
        cookiecutter ~/Documents/python_projects/python_template
11. Installed tox
        conda install -c conda-forge tox-conda
12. Made a tox.ini file
        Used the command tox-quickstart
13. Made a setup.py file
        You will need to manually set the setup file each time
14. Ran tox
        This made a .tox and new_project_directory.egg-info file
        You can now test your code with command "tox"
15. Added pycodestyle and pydocstyle to auto run on "tox" command
16. Tested that it all works
        cd ~/Documents/test
        cookiecutter ~/Documents/python_projects/python_template
        tox
17. Changed pycodestyle not to run on some files
18. Made a .env file. Still struggling to reference from it. Got it working
