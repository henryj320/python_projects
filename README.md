<h2>Future Project Ideas</h2>

<strong>Title:</strong> watt_checker<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python / Powershell<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Records the Watts-used by the laptop every 30 minutes. Record the value into an Excel spreadsheet so that a chart can be automatically generated or updated every day. Alternatively, use Python so that matplotlib and seaborn can be used.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> weekly_goals_GUI<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Shows a progress bar for your weekly goals. For example, a progress bar on how close to your reading goal you are. You could also autorun this on startup and set your background to the progress bars by screenshotting and setting as the wallpaper. It could also show how much of your 7.5 * 5 hrs of work you've done so far.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> total_screentime<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Android<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Records the screentime you have across all your devices, not just your mobile phone. May require some database or message sending between devices.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> wifi_users_tracker<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Linux Script<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> A software which states when a new device joins your WiFi network via a notification. It could be extended to show when a device disconnects. Previous implementation of this used a for loop to read the nmap's "x devices found" string.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> transcripter<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Learn how to make a transcripter that converts speech to text. Look into any existing libraries that allow for this.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> internet_stability_recorder<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Sends a ping every 5 minutes and records the result to Excel. Use the results to automatically plot into a chart. This would show how stable the internet is throughout the day.<br /><br />

<strong>Title:</strong> centre_country_shower<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> Shows the centre of a given country based on different factors: geological, average age, population, etc. This would show age densities, etc.<br /><br />
