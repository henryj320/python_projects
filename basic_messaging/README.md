<h2>basic_messaging</h2>

<strong>Title:</strong> basic_messaging<br />
<strong>Language:</strong> Python<br />
<strong>Overview:</strong> A basic messaging app. Effectively a prerequisite for tcp_message_sender_and_receiver. Use Flask to send a string from one endpoint (host:port pair) to another Python script. This project actually used the socket library. This project provides a basis for sending UDP data. It could be expanded to send and receive sensor data from Arduinos, for example.
