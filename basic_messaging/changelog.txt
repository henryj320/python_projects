1. Created a new virtual environment
        cd basic_messaging
        python3 -m venv venv
2. Activated the ve
        . venv/bin/activate
            (To deactivate it do deactivate)
3. conda install -c anaconda flask
3. Inside the ve, installed flask
        pip install flask
4. Ran the basic file
        python basic_file.py
        Looks like environment variables don't work inside the ve
5. Added hello_world()
6. Run it with flask --app basic_file run
7. Made it visible to anyone on the network
        flask run --host=0.0.0.0
8. Worked on the socket library instead
9. Made receiver.py
        Run with python receiver.py
10. Made sender.py
        Run in another terminal
        python sender.py
11. Changed it to work in the wider world
12. On Windows PC, enabled Telnet to check the port
        https://www.acronis.com/en-gb/blog/posts/telnet/
13. On Windows PC, ran telnet
        telnet Henry-Ideapad-Ubuntu 8001
            Could not open connection to the host. Connect failed
        telnet 192.168.1.1 8001
            Could not open connection to the host. Connect failed
        telnet 192.168.1.101 8001
            Could not open connection to the host. Connect failed
        telnet 209.35.89.171 8001
            Could not open connection to the host. Connect failed
        It is more complicated than expected to get the correct IP address1
14. Updated to allow incoming TCP on 8001
        sudo ufw allow from any to any port 8001 proto tcp
        Didn't fix the issue
15. Added an argument required for tcp or udp when runing the script
16. Cleaned up the sender.py with try statements
17. Wrote the udp sender
        https://code.activestate.com/recipes/578802-send-messages-between-computers/
18. Wrote the udp receiver
19. Tested with sender on another laptop
        0.0.0.0 didnt work
        192.168.1.1 didnt work
        192.168.1.101 worked!
20. Cleaned up the code with pycodestyle and pydocstyle
21. Basic code complete. Published feature/basic_messaging
        Run receiver: python receiver.py udp
        Run sender: python sender.py udp
