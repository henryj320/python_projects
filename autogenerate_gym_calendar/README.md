## autogenerate_gym_calendar

**Title**: autogenerate_gym_calendar

**Language**: Python

**Overview**: Investigate into whether it is possible to add events to your calendar given a form, just like barbers do. If you can, add a form to add your next week's gym schedule. There may be issues with adding to the correct calendar. The page could also allow the user to add an entire week's worth of gym sessions and runs at once. This would create a strong routine. You could even add missed muscles to the description of the gym sessions.
